[Elastica 6.1.1](https://github.com/ruflin/Elastica/tree/6.1.1) ([download](https://github.com/ruflin/Elastica/releases/tag/6.1.1)).

This release is compatible with Elasticsearch 6.x and was tested with [elasticsearch 6.5.2](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.5/release-notes-6.5.2.html).

### Added

* Added `BucketSelector` aggregation [#1554](https://github.com/ruflin/Elastica/pull/1554)
* Added `DerivativeAggregation` [#1553](https://github.com/ruflin/Elastica/pull/1553)
* The preferred type name is [_doc](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.5/removal-of-types.html), so that index APIs have the same path as they will have in 7.0
* Introduced new version of PHP-CS-Fixer and new Lint travis step. [#1555](https://github.com/ruflin/Elastica/pull/1555)

### Improvements

* Reduced memory footprint of response by not keeping the raw JSON data when JSON after JSON has been parsed. [#1588](https://github.com/ruflin/Elastica/pull/1588)
